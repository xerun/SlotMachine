# SlotMachine
A slot machine is a classic coin-operated rip-off gambling machine. Traditional slot machines have three reels and one payline, with each reel
labeled with about two dozen symbols. To use one, you insert coins into a slot and pull a handle that activates the spinning of the reels. After spinning a random number of times, the reels come to rest, showing three symbols lined up across the payline. If two or more of the symbols on the payline match, you will win a cash payout, which the slot machine dispenses back to you.
